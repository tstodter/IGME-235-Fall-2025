# IGME 235: Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers

## Course Overview

### Summary

**Official Course Description:** *This course introduces web technologies commonly used in the production and distribution of both content focused web sites, and in the creation of interactive applications and games. Students will create web sites and web-native interactive experiences, and publish them to the web. Programming projects are required.*

### About This Semester

This semester, there are **six** sections of this course. The exact expectations, due dates, etc for various homework, projects, and other assignments may vary between the sections.  However, all sections will be added to the same Slack workspace for general support and some exercises, etc.  There will also be individual "section-specific" channels where information and questions particular to your section can be posted and addressed.

## Prerequisites

IGME-110, Introduction to Interactive Media & IGME-106, Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II. 

Although it is helpful to come into the course with a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu aka banjo) it is not required. If you're entirely new to the material, you should be aware that you'll be expected to quickly and deeply engage the material in the beginning weeks through our provided readings and materials to get where you need to be.  

Lastly, this course involves a significant amount of coding in the JavaScript language, you should also feel confident in your programming skills in whatever other languages you know.

Important: This course replaces IGME-230, Web Site Design and Implementation. If you previously took (and passed) IGME-230, then you shouldnâ€™t be in this course.

**If you previously took any portion of this course (IGME-235), you must disclose this to your professor (via your initial Slack contact message) so that you can plan as appropriate to make sure that your work for this semester is unique from previous ones.**

## Texts & Materials

There is a required textbook for this course: *Learning Web Design, 5th Edition* by Jennifer Niederst Robbins. While it might be a good idea for you to purchase your own physical copy of it so that it's easy to reference, there is also free online access to the book through RIT Library's subscription to the O'Reilly Electronic Books service: [This link should take you directly to the book](https://go.oreilly.com/rochester-institute-of-technology/library/view/-/9781491960196/?ar).

In addition, there will be an assortment of online readings that you'll receive over the course of the semester. They will be uploaded to or linked to from our myCourses content area.

We will provide in-person summaries, video lectures with visible slides, exercises and other notes but these are designed to supplement, NOT replace the required textbook and readings.

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via GitHub and myCourses. You will be asked to create a GitHub repository and link to it for this course, however as of this time, you are not required to use it to store your code for the course. You'll be expected to Zip and submit (via myCourses) any assignments and in many cases post the work on your RIT "banjo or people.rit.edu" account as well.

myCourses will be used for announcements, links to course content, quizzes and exams, assignment submissions, and grading.

A course-wide Slack workspace provides an avenue of communication between professors, teaching assistants, and students. There is a channel on it for your section as well as help channels for different topic areas. There is more about Slack in the "Communication Guidelines" portion of this document.

Lastly, as this is a course on using Web technologies, you will be expected to publish assignments online using RIT's public-facing Web environment.

## Artificial Intelligence Usage

Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Claude Code, and others can be both a help and a hindrance. They can act as a force multiplier, boosting your efficiency, effectiveness, and creativity. However, relying on them too much may impact your learning of essential concepts. Additionally, some employers may not permit their intellectual property to be fed into these systems, and so disallow their usage.

In this class:
- You should use generative AI if I explicitly ask you to do so; you should not use generative AI if I explicitly forbid you from doing so.
- You should use generative AI if it enhances your work, but does not replace your understanding.
- Always document all tools and sources that significantly impacted your work (this would include generative AI).
- Use generative AI to quickly become effective with new tools and technology, but remain vigilant that you do not become dependent on them. Tools exist to expand your agency, and should be abandoned when they become limitations. 
- **Never** submit work taken directly from a machine.

You are responsible for understanding the course content on your own, and demonstrating this understanding, without machine assistance.

Failure to follow the guidelines above will be considered a violation of the Academic Integrity section of this syllabus.

## Grading & Assessment

Your final course grade will be determined based on the following course element weights & letter grade thresholds:

### Course Element Weights

| Course Element | Weight |
| :------------- | :----- |
| Projects | 40% |
| Midterm/Final Exam | 20% |
| Study Quizzes | 10% |
| Homework & other Assignments | 20% |
| Course Attendance* / Participation | 10% |

### Letter Grade Thresholds

| Grade Range | Letter Grade |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| >= 90 | A |
| >= 80 | B |
| >= 70 | C |
| >= 60 | D |
| < 65 | F |

### Evaluation Criteria

I will do my best to provide feedback for all submitted work within two weeks of the submission deadline (per University policy) and will post all grades to MyCourses. However, depending upon circumstance, feedback may be provided more than two weeks after the submission deadline.

In addition to the grade for projects, assignments, etc., I will add any additional notes and feedback to the grade in MyCourses.

If you have any questions about a grade, you are welcome to discuss with me further via email or in-person by scheduling a meeting.

## Course Elements

### PROJECTS (45%)

There are 3 major projects to be completed in the semester:

- Project 1 (15%) - One-Page Website
- Project 2 (15%) - Web Service Application
- Project 3 (15%) - Interactive Game/Experience
- **Grading:** Grades for your projects are determined based upon published rubrics that explain exactly how your projects will be assessed.
- **Submission:** Your projects will be submitted in phases, in some cases you'll start with a sketch and proposal, and then a wireframe or prototype with some "functionality" and early design will be submitted (this will be used for group critiques and feedback), and the final submission of the project will be a few days after the feedback process. They will need to be posted online and linked to from your course "home page" (created earlier in the semester)
- **Due Dates & Late Policy:** All assigned work (exercises, homeworks, quizzes, etc) is due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment drop box on MyCourses). Unless stated otherwise, there is no grade deduction for submitting work late. However, late submissions will not be accepted once we have graded the assignment in question. **We may grade an assignment at any point after the due date.** Prototypes due for project critique days cannot be accepted late.

### EXAMS (15%) ** This section subject to change **

There will be a Midterm Exam scheduled that consists of all manner of questions styles (multiple choice, true/false, matching, etc) as well as "write some code" questions. An optional, comprehensive Final Exam will offered at the end of the semester. Your earned exam score for the semester will be *the **highest** of these two scores*.

- **Grading:** A portion of either exam is automatically graded (similar to Study Quizzes -- see below) but there are are also short answer and written response type questions which will be graded by the instructor and partial credit may be awarded.
- **Submission:**
  - The Midterm is likely to be taken in-person for most sections this semester. This, however, may change depending on available time. If there is not time to take the midterm in-person, there will be a day (probably a Sunday) chosen for all sections who were not able to take the exam in-person to take the exam online during a range of open hours. Exact plans for this will be discussed in your section.
  - The Midterm will be taken online through myCourses. Your instructor will determine whether or not the exam is "Open Book" or "Open Internet resources" and to what extent.
  - The Final Exam, however (if you wish to take it), must be taken in-person during the scheduled exam time. What resources (if any) you will be allowed to use will be, again, determined by your instructor an announced in advance.
- **Due Dates & Late Policy:** The exact date for the Midterm is yet to be determined. If you're unable to make it, you may be able to plan an alternative with your instructor, However, missing or intentionally not taking the Midterm means that you'll NEED to take the Final Exam to earn up to 15% of your grade.

### STUDY QUIZZES (10%)

"Study Quizzes" are relatively easy, open-book/notes, re-takeable quizzes (up to 3 times), available well in advance on myCourses which you are *expected* to complete online prior to working on your related lab exercises. They are intended to prepare you for hands-on web development exercises. A majority of questions on the Exams will also come directly from (or be highly inspired by) these quizzes.

- **Grading:** Study Quizzes are automatically graded and the results (showing only which questions you got wrong, but not the correct answers) are available immediately. You can take the quiz up to three times in order to improve your score. The best score of the 3 attempts will be included in your Study Quiz average.
- **Submission:** These are open-book and completed through myCourses.
- **Due Dates & Late Policy:** Due dates for Study Quizzes will vary by section, typically due before in-person meeting times. Consult the weekly checklist for what should be done before what lab exercise. You should try to complete Study Quizzes before they are "due", however you can continue to complete study quizzes for credit as long as the Study Quiz is still available in myCourses ("closing dates" will be announced). Consistent late submission of Study Quizzes is likely to trigger Starfish alerts.

### HOMEWORK AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS (25%)

Homework, lab exercises, checkpoints, and other assignments are essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of two "study quizzes" and one or two other outside assignments per week. Keep an eye on the myCourses Assignments section for the due dates.

- **Grading:** Homeworks are graded according to the requirements described in the assignment information, however a full rubric is not provided in advance. You should do your best to complete them as they are described. Lab *Exercises*, however do not have to be completed perfectly to get credit, it should just be evident that you made a good effort to engage the material and complete the exercise. They are not frequently submitted nor graded in detail.
- **Submission:** Read the submission requirements carefully for each assignment. Some assignments should not be posted online (due to potential for academic dishonesty), but each one will explain how and where to post and submit your work. Unless instructed otherwise, always remember to ZIP all files uploaded to my courses (regardless of size and number of files)
- **Due Dates & Late Policy:** All assigned work (exercises, homeworks, quizzes, etc) is due at the announced date and time (usually the due date posted with the assignment drop box on MyCourses). Unless stated otherwise, there is no grade deduction for submitting work late. However, late submissions will not be accepted once we have graded the assignment in question. **We may grade an assignment at any point after the due date.** Prototypes due for project critique days cannot be accepted late. Exams may not be made up late, unless you have made an alternative plan with me. If you foresee a scheduling conflict with a posted assignment, contact me as soon as possible to work out an alternative submission plan.

### COURSE ATTENDANCE & PARTICIPATION (5%+)

We require all students to engage in the course through consistent attendance and online participation. There are numerous posts in our Slack workspace that you are expected to make including introductory posts, exercise submissions, and more. In addition, you are highly encouraged to watch any online lecture videos that are relevant to you (especially if you've missed the in-person class!).

- **Grading:** Attending all classes and doing all expected activities gets you a full 5% credit, but each instance of not attending or participating when expected will generally drop your score in this category by 1%. **After you've lost 5% in this category, your final grade will continue to drop by up to 5% per additional incident.**
- **Submission:** There is no submit, only do (and attend). That is, just show up to class and watch the checklists and the assignments and if they ask you to do something, do it. Also, it would be great if you can participate in the question and answer channels as well and extend your assistance if you know the answer to course related questions, etc.
- **Due Dates & Late Policy:** If you will miss a particular class, be late to class, or be unable to participate in online activities, contact your instructor in advance via Slack DM. You may not get a response before the actual class time, but the record will be there and your instructor can respond and/or record your participation appropriately.

## Academic Integrity

The RIT policy on academic dishonesty is available at: http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html. I have a responsibility to the university to ensure that academic dishonesty does not happen by anyone in my courses and I take this responsibility very seriously. I also think upholding academic integrity is simply the right thing to do.

In this course, if you violate the academic dishonesty policy, you will receive an "F" grade for the course, I will file a letter with the department detailing the incident for your records folder, and you will be immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

I really hate to see anyone fail a course this way, so if you have any questions about your work and these policies, the easiest thing to do is to double-check with me before submitting your work. That way, I can let you know if there's any issues and we can ensure your work is safe to submit.


## One Last Important Note

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Moreover, those with marginalized identities may be faced with additional social stressors. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable. In addition to your academic advisor, We strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you.
